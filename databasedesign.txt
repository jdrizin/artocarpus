#this file will document the tables and fields for our database.

ID, AnnotationID, GeneticID
	these fields are ID linking fields. AnnotationID and GeneticID are 
	probably superfluous. Once I confirm that they are, I'll remove them.
	ID is set up as a Primary Key, is NOT NULL and AUTO_INCREMENT.

MostRecent[Family,Genus,Species]
	i'm told that these should be renamed to Accepted or Current, and 
	represent the most current name for that individual. we don't have a 
	history for the names and why they were changed. If we have this 
	information, I have an idea for a table that might work: a table with 
	ID, Name, Authority, date changed, and reason for changing. When 
	building a table, you'd join using only the newest of each duplicated
	ID.

MostRecentAltID
   Yet another place for IDs.

QuestionedID, MostRecentIDNotes
	the former is a boolean, the latter notes

Genus, Species, Species Authority, SubspVar, SubspeciesAuthority
	Not sure. Were these transcribed from vouchers? They seem to mainly match
   MostRecent*. I might normalize this out 

DeterminedBy, HerbariumCollection, Collector, CollectionNumber, CollectionDate
VoucherLocations
	this is all herbarium voucher information, or material vouchers.

Vernacular
	This is generally a local name or 

Month, Day, Year
	these are different from CollectionData, and not totally filled out. Looks
   like a failed attempt to extract dates. These will be deleted in favor of
   a rectified date field.

SheetScanNumber, Image_location
	i believe these refer to image filenames, but these are not 
	currently accessible

AccessionNumber
	the organization's internal accesion information

PlantDescription, Reproductive, Type, Notes, Project
	text description of the materials?

LocationInfo, Habitat, StateDepProv, Country
	these are in the wrong place due to my error, but i'm not sure what they	contain.
	i need to put them back, so i'll figure that out with the access db

# annotations            # 
##########################

AnnotationsID, fk_annotations_collection_ID
	these two fields should always be the same. I'm not sure if the former 
	is really necessary, but the latter is a foreign key constraint on 
	collection.ID, so you need to use valid collection.ID numbers.

Annotation 
	I'm not really sure what exactly this represents. This is still a mess,
   but ought to include the latest names for the individuals, if they're
   differing from MostRecent* and other things. Some of them have material

   use information or other, unrelated fields and should be split out
##########################
# geneticproject         #
##########################

GeneticProjectID, GeneticID, fk_genetic_collection_ID
	currently, the latter two are the same, and I believe the former is too.
	I don't know why the GeneticProjectID exists. if we want multiple 
	project support, we might want multiple tables, but it depends on 
	the data.

Everything else: extraction-related information

##########################
# geospatial
##########################
geoID, fk_geospatial_collection_ID
	both the same, foreign key constraint, etc

Latitude, Longitude, Elevation
	Spatial information, collected by gps or through maps. they may be estimates.

LatLongEstAccuracy, LatLongEstNotes
	Where Greg was guessing at the location based on descriptions or island names or locations.

##########################
# colbydatasummary
##########################
I don't really know what's going on here. The IDs don't match up with the main 
	DB, i don't think, and we might just start keeping different projects 
	in different databases, or a student database, or something like that.
