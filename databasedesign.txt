ID 
	This field is the main field for linking all other records.
	ID is set up as a Primary Key, is NOT NULL and AUTO_INCREMENT.

MostRecent[Family,Genus,Species]
	i'm told that these should be renamed to Accepted or Current
	These represent the most current name for each individual. The
	annotations table includes some other information from other sources.
	
	I have an idea for a table that would work: a table with 
	ID, Name, Authority, date changed, and reason for changing. When 
	building a table, you'd join using only the newest of each duplicated
	ID.

MostRecentAltID
   Generally a local name or a translation of one

QuestionedID, MostRecentIDNotes
	the former ought to be a boolean but isn't, the latter notes

StateDepProv, Country
	location of collection. may be from vouchers, but more useful in this table

Notes, Project
	additional info, not sure.

##########################
# herbarium              #
##########################

Genus, Species, Species Authority, SubspVar, SubspeciesAuthority
	these were transcribed from vouchers. They seem to mainly match
   MostRecent*, aside from spelling issues or questioned IDs in these fields

DeterminedBy, HerbariumCollection, Collector, CollectionNumber, CollectionDate
VoucherLocations
	this is all herbarium voucher information, or material vouchers.

CollectionDateGood
	the rectified collection data, in YYYY-MM-DD format. dummy dates ARE used,
	1111-01-01 is for missing dates, 01 is inserted when data was missing. if
	you want to know the real date, look at CollectionDate.

Vernacular
	This is generally a local name or other type of synonym, but not in latin. 

SheetScanNumber, Image_location
	these refer to image filenames, but need to be normalized out and the
	fields with commas turned into seperate ones. we can use a one-to-many
	relationship for a new table

AccessionNumber
	the organization's internal accesion information

PlantDescription, Reproductive, Type, 
	text description of the materials?

LocationInfo, Habitat, 
	these are in the wrong place due to my error, but i'm not sure what they	contain.
	i need to put them back, so i'll figure that out with the access db

##########################
# annotations            # 
##########################

AnnotationsID, fk_annotations_collection_ID
	these two fields should always be the same. I'm not sure if the former 
	is really necessary, but the latter is a foreign key constraint on 
	collection.ID, so you need to use valid collection.ID numbers.

Genus,species
	genus and species, where available

Annotation 
	includes information about the naming of that individual. has a few dna
	entries that are not yet split out

AnnoDate
	cleaned-up date for annotations, in YYYY-MM-DD. see the other date entry
	for information about dummy dates

   use information or other, unrelated fields and should be split out
##########################
# geneticproject         #
##########################

GeneticProjectID, GeneticID, fk_genetic_collection_ID
	currently, the latter two are the same, and I believe the former is too.
	I don't know why the GeneticProjectID exists. if we want multiple 
	project support, we might want multiple tables, but it depends on 
	the data.

Everything else: extraction-related information

##########################
# geospatial
##########################
geoID, fk_geospatial_collection_ID
	both the same, foreign key constraint, etc

Latitude, Longitude, Elevation
	Spatial information, collected by gps or through maps. they may be estimates.

LatLongEstAccuracy, LatLongEstNotes
	Where Greg was guessing at the location based on descriptions or island names or locations.

##########################
# images
##########################

imageID, fk_images_collection_ID
	id that links to collection.id

filename
	simply the number of the scan, though this is bad form, since the actual
	images are called IMG_####.jpg. we should store the actual filename.

##########################
# colbydatasummary
##########################
I don't really know what's going on here. The IDs don't match up with the main 
	DB, i don't think, and we might just start keeping different projects 
	in different databases, or a student database, or something like that.
